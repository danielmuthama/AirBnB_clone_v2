## Description :house:

HolbertonBnB is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and
database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a
clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using
Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web
servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy.

HolbertonBnB is still in active development, with complete functionality set to
deploy in the coming month:

* Complete integration of a RESTful API
* Full configuration of website with domain name
* Serving of dynamic content using JavaScript

## NOTE TO 2019 LYFT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING APPRENTICESHIP RECRUITER

This web app has been the capstone project of my full-stack education at
Holberton School and I want to show it off as a demonstration of all the
skills I've learned at this school.

With that said, I must clarify that it is not complete. As mentioned, the
clone is a work-in-progress, with full deployment as a RESTful API still to
come. Finishing touches will be occurring over the next month, my final at
Holberton.

Recognizing that I am sharing a near-complete project, I additionally put
together a small Flask app according to the specifications described in the
application. Please take a look at this separate repository here:

https://github.com/bdbaraban/lyft_apprenticeship_application

Nonetheless, allow me to talk a little more about this AirBnB clone. This
repository is the second iteration of the project. In the first version
(viewable [here](https://github.com/bdbaraban/AirBnB_clone)), I, together
with a cohort mate, built up the initial file storage back-end and
console from scratch. We pair programmed for most all of this version one work.

In this second iteration of the project, I, together with a new partner,
inherited a different version of the same back-end written by a pair of
Holberton students from an older cohort. We then pair programmed
to build up the database storage engine of the back-end.

In between each version, I put together an entire CSS-styled HTML web page
for the project. This front-end development was coded independently, although
the HTML files I personally wrote are only posted in
[version one](https://github.com/bdbaraban/AirBnB_clone) (the
[web_static](./web_static) folder in this directory was included in the
fork). Addtionally, all Shell, Puppet, and Fabric deployment scripts/manifests
were coded myself.

The README's in both repositories were almost exclusively written myself.

I hope this helps clear things up. I apologize for the confusing versioning, but
the takeaway is that I've been directly involved in coding at least _an_ implementation
of everything in this repository. And hey, software development is no fun without
some confusing version control, right? :sweat_smile: :sob:

Please let me know if you have any questions!

### Static :page_facing_up:

The front-end of HolbertonBnB was designed from scratch using HTML5/CSS3 pages
integrated using Flask. While the front-end has not yet been officially deployed,
screenshots are viewable in the README of the [web_flask](./web_flask) directory.

### Classes :cl:

HolbertonBnB supports the following classes:

* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

## Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by one of either two abstracted storage engines,
depending on the call - [FileStorage](./models/engine/file_storage.py) or
[DBStorage](./models/engine/db_storage.py).

### FileStorage

The default mode.

In `FileStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB
instantiates an instance of `FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage`
object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file
`file.json`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

### DBStorage

Run by setting the environmental variables `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`.

In `DBStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB
instantiates an instance of `DBStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object
is loaded/re-loaded from the MySQL database specified in the environmental variable
`HBNB_MYSQL_DB`, using the user `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`, password `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`, and
host `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register changes in the corresponding MySQL database.
Connection and querying is achieved using SQLAlchemy.

Note that the databases specified for `DBStorage` to connect to must already be
defined on the MySQL server. This repository includes scripts
[setup_mysql_dev.sql](./setup_mysql_dev.sql) and [setup_mysql_test.sql](./setup_mysql_test.sql)
to set up `hbnb_dev_db` and `hbnb_test_db` databases in a MySQL server,
respectively.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend
of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```

Remember, the console can be run with `storage` instantiated in either `FileStorage`
or `DBStorage` mode. The above examples instantiate `FileStorage` by default, but
`DBStorage` can be instantiated like so:

```
$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py
```

The console functions identically regardless of the `storage` mode.

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```

### Console Commands

The HolbertonBnB console supports the following commands:

#### create
* Usage: `create <class> <param 1 name>=<param 1 value> <param 2 name>=<param 2 value> ...`

Creates a new instance of a given class. The class' ID is printed and
the instance is saved to the file `file.json`. When passing parameter key/value
pairs, any underscores contained in value strings are replaced by spaces.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create BaseModel
119be863-6fe5-437e-a180-b9892e8746b8
(hbnb)

```

#### show
* Usage: `show <class> <id>` or `<class>.show(<id>)`

## Testing :straight_ruler:

Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the [tests](./tests)
folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
